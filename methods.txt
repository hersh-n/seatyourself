Reservation

	Check if there are reservations during the time slot requested
		
		If there are, display them in their containers

		If not, don't display

		If none, display there are none available


Table

	Check if there are appropriate tables to fulfil a reservation 

	Iterate through tables, for 2s, 4s, 6s check if there are tables within 1 person size of the requested amount. For 10, anything above 6 will work. Fuck adding table together right now.
